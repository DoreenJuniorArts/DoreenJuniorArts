	<h2>Weekday classes</h2>
				<h3> <a href="https://forms.gle/Mk1dmRqSBAnK4gzFA">WEDNESDAY WAITING LIST</a> </h3>
				<h3> <a href="https://forms.gle/GwWhEukZUekf9wBo7">THURSDAY WAITING LIST</a> </h3>
				
				<img src="wednesdaykids.jpeg" width="460" alt="wednesday kids" class= "item"/><img src="thandi.jpg" width="188" alt="wednesday kids 2" class= "item"><img src="samar.jpeg" width="193" alt="wednesday kids 3" class= "item">
				
	
				<p><b>Times:</b> Wednesday 4:15pm - 5:15pm / Thursday 4:45pm - 5:45pm</p>

				<p><b>Age:</b> 7-12</p>
				<p><b>Price:</b> $25 per week, or $200-$250 depending on term length</p>

<p>These weekday classes blend a skilled program and a social group by allowing the kids freedom on what they create in the class. The kids will actively get to choose what materials they would like to work with, if they would like to work individually or collaboratively and give their input on what supplies we order for the room.

				<p><b>Age:</b> 7-12</p>
				<p><b>Price:</b> $30-$50pp</p>

<p>Sunday workshops are the classes that started Doreen Junior Arts. Unlike our weekday classes, these sessions are meant to build fundamental art skills and lay a baseline for young artists. Every week has a different theme and you are welcome to pick and choose which classes to enrol in based on your child’s interests. </p>

<p>Kids that attend regularly will be provided with their own workbook to assist them in the planning stages of their creations.

				<p><b>Age:</b> 7-11 / 12-15</p>
				<p><b>Price:</b> $40 per class, $110 for 3 or $200 for the full program</p>
				
	<p>Every school holidays Doreen Junior Arts runs the Arty Kids and Creative Teens programs. These consist of 3x 2 hour classes per week. Every school holidays the workshops switch around, so keep your eye out for the newest program list around 2-3 weeks before the next holidays begin. </p>

<p>The school holiday program classes are a good combination of the workshops and weekday classes. Each day is structured with a goal in mind, but with the 2 hour time frame the kids have plenty of time to be silly and make friends while they’re there.</p>
